## 3. Installation & Requirements

1. Install a python environment with jupyter notebooks (e.g., [anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)).

2. Create an environment with the required packages by running on the anaconda shell:
```
conda env create -f environment.yml --name myenv
conda activate myenv
```

3. Run individual notebooks in the following order:

  1. `notebooks/nb01_data-exploration.ipynb`
  2. `notebooks/nb02_modeling-part1.ipynb`
  3. `notebooks/nb03_modeling-part2.ipynb`
